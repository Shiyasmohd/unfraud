## A Decentralized AI-based application in detecting healthcare fraud claims 

## What are healthcare frauds?

 Healthcare or medical insurance fraud is the form of executing treatments to render medically unnecessary or over-utilizing services that result in useless costs to the healthcare system. Potential offenders may include patients, hospitals, doctors, vendors, suppliers, or pharmacists. The government claims that because of Medicare claim fraud, overall Medicare spending has exponentially increased.
Rigorous analysis of Medicare data has yielded many physicians who indulge in fraud. They adopt ways in which an ambiguous diagnosis code is used to adapt the costliest procedures and drugs. Insurance companies are the most vulnerable institutions impacted due to these bad practices. Due to this reason, insurance companies increased their insurance premiums, and as a result, healthcare is becoming more costly matter day by day.

## Impacts of healthcare frauds

- The claims made in the medical healthcare sector alone represent more than 15% of the total scam
- As per the reports, it is stated that India's medical sector loses about 600-800 crore rupees every year.

## Solution proposed  

We propose a decentralized AI-based platform that detects fraud in real-time. To receive a claim, a user must submit the appropriate information to our forum. Our advanced AI which contains NLP models and simple ML models reviews the given information and if it finds fraud rejects the data transaction; however if itâ€™s a genuine claim, the data is saved into a blockchain. Additionally, we offer an AI-based emergency summary sheet compressing health conditions and their risk from the information on their previous medical claims. Finally, we have a QR code that displays the emergency information tab when scanned with an authorized hospital IP address to access this data and we also provide a consent OTP system to authorized relatives permission to access this data.
